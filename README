Using Python's Selenium package, this script allows users to programatically investigate Literature Online's textual database. Users may feed the routine a text document that contains one or more words or linguistic strings of interest. The script sends each of these strings to Literature Online and pulls down the name, publication date, authoship information, and related metadata of texts that contain those strings. By changing parameters within the routine, users may execute lemmatized and fuzzy spelling searches as well. Users can then use the scripts output to plot macroanalytic trends in the history of words, collocates, and genres, or simply to help allocate their readerly attention in a more efficient manner.
