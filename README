Using Python's Selenium package, this script allows users to programatically investigate Literature Online's rich textual database. The script runs as follows: Users feed the routine a text document that contains one or more words or linguistic strings of interest. The script takes each of these strings, sends them to Literature Online, and pulls down the name, publication date, and author of texts that contain those strings. By changing some of the parameters within the script, users may execute lemmatized and fuzzy spelling searches as well. Users can then use the scripts output to plot macroanalytic trends in the history of words, collocates, and genres, or simply to help allocate their readerly attention in a more efficient manner.
